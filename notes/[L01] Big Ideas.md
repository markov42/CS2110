# Big Idea 1
- all computers compute the same kinds of things called Turing-equivalence

# Big Idea 2
- abstraction: layers makes the electrons work

# Big Idea 3
- binary
- binary is better than decimal for electronic computing
- easier to determine presence rather than a magnitude
- you can use lower voltages to distinguish only 0/1 rather than 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9
- binary-coded decimal math takes more circuitry than pure binary

## Big Idea 4
- computers store representations of something outside
- everything in a computer is a finite-size representation of something outside
